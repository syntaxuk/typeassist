TypeAssist is a lightweight, open-source script that can automatically type for you on TypeRacer. It’s a simple helper—nothing complicated.

# How it works

1. Paste the script into your browser console while on TypeRacer.com.

2. The script detects the site and activates the TypeAssist interface.

3. Once active, it can type automatically for you in races.

# Supported sites

# How to use
