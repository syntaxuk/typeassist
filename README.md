**typeassist**

typeassist is a simple, open-source script that can type automatically for you on certain sites. it’s just a small helper—nothing complicated.

**how it works**

1. paste the script into your console on a typing site

2. it checks the URL to see which site you’re on

3. if the site is supported, it brings up the gui if not, it’ll tell you it’s not supported

**supported sites**
none yet, but more will be added soon
